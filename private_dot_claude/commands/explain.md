# Explain Codebase

Analyze the entire codebase and provide a comprehensive explanation that includes:

1. **Project Overview**: What the project does and its main purpose
2. **Architecture**: High-level structure and design patterns used
3. **Key Components**: Main files, directories, and their responsibilities
4. **Data Flow**: How information moves through the system
5. **Dependencies**: Important external libraries and their roles
6. **Entry Points**: Where execution begins (main files, endpoints, etc.)
7. **Connections**: How different parts interact with each other

Present the explanation in clear, beginner-friendly language with:
- Visual hierarchy using headers and sections
- Code examples for key concepts where helpful
- Analogies or comparisons to make complex ideas accessible
- A summary of the most important takeaways

Focus on understanding rather than exhaustive detail - prioritize clarity over comprehensiveness.
