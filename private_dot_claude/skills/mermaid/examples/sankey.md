## Data Format

The CSV-like format requires three columns:
- **Source**: Starting node
- **Target**: Ending node  
- **Value**: Flow amount (positive number)

## Tips

- Values represent flow magnitude/quantity
- Node names are case-sensitive
- Flows are directional (Source â†’ Target)
- Larger values = thicker flows
- Use meaningful node names
- Group related flows for clarity
- Keep node count reasonable (< 20 for readability)
- Values should be proportional and meaningful
- Perfect for: conversions, distributions, processes, journeys
- Show where quantities split, merge, or transform
