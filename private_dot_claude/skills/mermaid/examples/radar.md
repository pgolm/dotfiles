## Tips

- Use for multi-dimensional comparisons
- Scale values consistently (0-100 is common)
- Limit categories to 5-8 for readability
- Compare similar entities
- Larger area = better overall performance
- Use different data series for comparison
- Categories should be independent metrics
- Perfect for: skill assessments, product comparisons, evaluations
- Values should be normalized to same scale
- Label axes clearly
